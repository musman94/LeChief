Final Year Project
A desktop Unity application to help train Music Conduncting Students practise conducting movements without the need of musicians being present in front. The app uses Leap Motion controller to track the hand movements of the user, then compares it to the expected movements which were collected with the help of professional conductors. There are several differnt songs from which the user can select to practice on. After each practice session the user is shown his/her score and he/she can progress onto further levels if that score is good enough.
